Client-Server Model using C++ Socket Programming
- Run the .exe files--specify 'localhost' as a parameter for the client
    - This is malleable
- Client sends the first message to the server
- The server responds in kind
- Both the client & the server use user input for their messages
- Conversation continues until one party sends the '#' character
- Uses the Microsoft Winsock library
